As night begins to fall I think about Wuthering Heights, Cathy’s wild spirit. Everything here looks so serene; but there is something about the moors that makes me feel feral, too. Everything has so much texture, looking isn’t enough. I want the thorny gorse to prick my skin, draw blood and keep a piece of me. 
I want my hands all over the warm rocks of all the Tors. I want my bare feet in the icy river water, flowing slowly and russet like maple syrup. I want the spring of featherbeds beneath me and to sink into sudden mud and water, knee deep. 
I want the hot rush of adrenaline. I want to be frightened, just enough. I want to taste the dew on the morning air and the spicy odour of sheep droppings as the sun heats the ground. I want the coconut scent of gorse and the bitter smell of fern leaves. I want the rush of rivers and waterfalls and the stagnant stillness of the bogs.
I want to touch, feel, I want to inhabit every bit of my skin and rub up against this wild spot of nature.
