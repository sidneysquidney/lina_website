Our trip coincides with the release of Taylor Swift’s new album, folklore. To me, it’s the perfect soundtrack to accompany us on our two hour drive into the wild heart of Devon. It drips with nostalgia, whimsy and sensual enchantment. My fiancé, who does not share my taste in music, indulges me. He drives and I feel a strange sense of security, akin to that experienced only in early childhood. I direct us, badly, but do well at announcing every grazing sheep, cow or horse we pass along the M5.
