Nature is, with or without me, with or without us, we are but mayflies, in a timeline that exceeds anything within the bounds of our imagination. My skin is too tight around my body from the unexpected rush of happiness it now needs to contain and my heart swells, beat accelerating, tripping itself up a little and I feel like it might burst through my ribcage, pieces swimming around my body like fragments of a hand grenade. 
I photograph the horses and thank them silently before I return to camp. I find my fianc√© lying on the tent bags playing online chess. We are not good at setting up, but manage. The bleating of the lambs sounds like someone crying help! help!
