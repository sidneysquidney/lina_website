Crossing the cattle grid means passing the threshold to the Moor. It also feels like crossing the threshold to my past. I have no roots here, there is no genetic history that ties me to this place and yet, as I ache to get out of the car, there is a definite sensation of coming home. 
There is joy too, the unapologetic kind you experience only before your body ever learns of guilt. We park in a lay-by and consult the wild-camping map to make double sure we’re within the big purple patch that looks like a bruise blooming in the centre of Dartmoor. 
There is a tang to the air that whips around us. Coppery, bitter, ancient. With our gear on our backs, we hike down a sloping path and find camp near a river. I have learned quickly to avoid the featherbeds that lure you in and suddenly swallow you calf-deep. Bright green areas promise solid ground. 
My fiancé can sense my giddiness and waves me off, announcing he will set up the tent. Holding my camera, I meander along the river. Ahead I spot a herd of wild horses, two of the mares have foals who are chasing each other across the heather. I laugh and the sound of it surprises me. 
Spontaneously, I bend forwards and make knots come undone with two gentle tugs. I remove my shoes, my socks and leave them to retrieve later. The floor gives slightly under my soles and the sensation of the thick soil, of the earth holding me up and pulling me down humbles me. Something is drawing me towards the horses. There is magic in seeing them in the wild. The roughness of the ground cuts into my pampered skin. I watch the foals and their mothers. They register my presence but seem neither afraid nor interested. I feel small, like my presence doesn’t matter here, and an exhale I didn’t know I needed deflates my lungs.
