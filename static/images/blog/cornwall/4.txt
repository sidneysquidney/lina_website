The sea runs through my life like a theme through a collection of poetry. 
Ice cream cones and sandcastles, my father burying me and my sister in wet sand, playing catch with the waves. Dry feet always a sign of triumph. Later, beach parties and boys with guitars. Watermelon, tan lines, stolen lip-gloss kisses. Discovering how cold sand feels in the night. A boy’s hand on my thigh, nervously wondering if I want this. Later, weekends with the girls. Surfboards and coral scratches. Bruises and new tattoos. Girls playing guitars. Blankets and tea and illegal driftwood-fires. Memories of people we lost, breakups we healed from, dreams we’re chasing.
