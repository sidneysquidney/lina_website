Collecting rocks and shells along the shore, an entire universe of intricate geometry. Pockets heavy with trinkets. 
Watching from the shore as he swims in the stormy sea. Grey water on pale skin, muscles flexing as fingers slice the surface. When he returns I trace the goosebumps on his arms, touch the drops in the tips of his hair. His face is flushed and cold at the same time and afterwards we read together, our bodies languid on the jagged rocks. We fall asleep and when we wake, the incoming tide has almost cut us off from the beach. 
Who do you think of when you look out across the water?
