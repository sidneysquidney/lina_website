Hot skin and cold sweat from hiking up and down the coastal path. Brambles snatch at my ankles like jealous ex-lovers and the nettles sting like a mother’s scorn.  By the time we reach the shore, my legs are quietly bleeding from countless little cuts. The seawater licks my wounds with cool grace and I wade in deeper, wanting it to hug my entire body with its steady ebb and flow. 
Waking up to the smell of fresh coffee and scrambled eggs and clean linen. Trying to eat a grapefruit with a spoon and failing. The apple orchard, the smell that is at once sweet and rotten. Cider, wasps. The screech of a barn owl.
Fire pit, the knowledge that in weeks to come my clothes will still smell like glowing embers, that I’ll feel nostalgic about the present moment.
