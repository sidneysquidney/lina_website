The service stations along the M4, like checkpoints in a marathon. The magical, feeling of going on a road trip. The illicit, conspiratorial sensation of sweets and bitter coffee after dark, at seventy miles an hour.
The subtle change in the air as we get closer to the sea. Fresh and salty, like it could leave a crystalline coat of white on your skin; like if you licked it your tongue would tingle.
