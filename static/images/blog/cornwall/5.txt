And now; watching the dogs snap at the whipped edges of rolling waves, the imprints of their paws erased by the backwash. Exploring the rock-pools, swimming in the cove in September, seaweed on my bellybutton. Sunsets, fish and chips, him playing the guitar. Climbing rocks and jumping fences. His hand touching my hand, knowing that I want this.
